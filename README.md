OpenHI
======

What?
-----

This aims to be a recreation of Sunflower's Holiday Island.

It is implemented in lua for [love2d](http://love2d.org).

What is currently working?
--------------------------

The code currently loads straight sand, grass and water tiles from the original
Holiday Island graphiks and draws them randomly on a 200x200 tiles grid. Also
you can scroll while holding the right mouse button.

What needs to be done?
----------------------

Well... Everything...

- Load all other ground tiles
- Generate actual maps with coastlines and rivers and different heights
- Implement the game logic (building, money, events, AI opponents, ...)

How can I test this?
